## Usage
This project will not work without an API key, this data has been omitted from github for obvious reasons, You can grab an API key from https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey assuming you have a steam account which has spent money in the store, then place it into a file as "\src\features\api\apikey.js" - "export const apikey = 'apiStringHere'" .
With all the files on your computer, should be able to run it via npm start (maybe npm install first) though in practice this seems to result in a CORS error - I've managed to work around this with this [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
